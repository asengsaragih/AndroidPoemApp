    <string name="poem_sample">So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse,\nAnd found such fair assistance in my verse\nAs every alien pen hath got my use,\nAnd under thee their poesy disperse.\nThine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing,\nAnd heavy ignorance aloft to fly,\nHave added feathers to the learnèd\'s wing\nAnd given grace a double majesty.\nYet be most proud of that which I compile,\nWhose influence is thine, and born of thee.\nIn others\' works thou dost but mend the style,\nAnd arts with thy sweet graces gracèd be.\n But thou art all my art, and dost advance\n As high as learning my rude ignorance.</string>
